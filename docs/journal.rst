Original code inspiration: https://github.com/avrabyt/RAG-Chatbot

Next Steps (Debugging & Experimental)
=====================================

* Update the readme file
* Add a way to minimize token length of chat history as the conversation gets longer
* Check if information extracted from tables in the pdf is correct e.g. key_facts.pdf
